# 📈 Fixed Income Yield to Maturity (YTM) Calculator - C++

This is a CLI-based tool that calculates the **Yield to Maturity (YTM)** for a fixed income bond using the **Newton-Raphson method**. Built with modern C++ practices, it’s ideal for finance and analytics-focused development roles.

---

## 🔍 Features

- Computes the fair yield (YTM) for a bond based on:
  - Face value
  - Coupon rate
  - Years to maturity
  - Market price
- Uses numerical methods (Newton-Raphson) for iterative approximation.
- Demonstrates OOP-friendly structure and mathematical modeling in C++.
